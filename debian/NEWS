perf-tools-unstable (0.0.1~20160212+git0c13e83-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with version 0.0.1~20160212+git0c13e83-2, all binary files
  have been renamed to $filename-perf suffix.
  .
  For example: execsnoop => execsnoop-perf
  .
  Similarly, the manpages have been renamed. This is done to accommodate
  users who would like to use perf-tools-unstable, parallely with the
  eBPF Compiler Collection Tools from the bpfcc package.
  .
  Both upstreams work closely on the projects, thus the common names.
